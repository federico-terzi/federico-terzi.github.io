Then things get a bit tricky, as posting on other subreddits would usually result in a ghost ban. To overcome this problem, the key is to provide value. Does your project solve some interesting technical challenges? If the answer is yes, it may be a good idea to write an "},{type:b,tag:p,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"article"}]},{type:a,value:" and posting it on a related subreddit. Inside the article, you can "},{type:b,tag:p,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"mention"}]},{type:a,value:" your project, so that new people get to know it, without looking spammy. For example, because I couldn’t find any resource about publishing a Rust project on Homebrew when working on espanso, I decided to "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Ffedericoterzi.com\u002Fblog\u002Fhow-to-publish-your-rust-project-on-homebrew\u002F",rel:[f,g,h],target:i},children:[{type:a,value:"write an article"}]},{type:a,value:" about the process and then I published it on "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.reddit.com\u002Fr\u002FRust",rel:[f,g,h],target:i},children:[{type:a,value:"r\u002Frust"}]},{type:a,value:".
