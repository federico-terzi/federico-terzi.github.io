> Welcome to _Understanding CRDTs_, a series of articles in which we’ll discuss CRDTs from the ground up. We’ll start from the basic concepts, trying to discuss different algorithms and data structures using simple JavaScript implementations, and we’ll gradually work towards a high-performance, JSON CRDT implementation written in Rust.
